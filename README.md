SQL-Analysis
The SQL analysis of Adidas sales data involved querying and processing datasets to uncover valuable insights into sales performance and strategic opportunities. The analysis revealed key trends across product categories, regions, and customer channels, highlighting the dominance of Men's Street Footwear as the top-performing product with 37,358 units sold, while Men's Apparel lagged behind with 19,140 units sold. Regional analysis showed the West and Northeast as the strongest markets, with the South trailing in performance. Sales channel evaluation emphasized the prominence of online sales, particularly in the Southeast region, while retailer analysis showcased significant growth for Foot Locker and Sports Direct, contrasted by a decline in sales for West Gear. Based on these insights, the analysis provided actionable recommendations, including focusing on high-performing regions, addressing underperforming areas, and tailoring product offerings to meet customer demand. This project demonstrated the effectiveness of SQL in extracting data-driven insights to support Adidas in optimizing sales strategies and driving growth.
